# Pizza-Website

a web-based application that allows users to create and insert pizza orders into a database and generate sales reports and charts from the database. I utilized NumPy and Matplotlib
pythin libraries to analyze the database data and generate grpahs.
I built the app's backend on functionality provided by XAMPP and integrated JSON format to pass data between languages.
